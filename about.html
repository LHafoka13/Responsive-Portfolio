            <p>My name is Lily'okalani Hafoka, and I did not know that I wanted to be a Full-Stack Developer until COVID hit. I graduated from Metropolitan State University of Denver in 2017 with a B.A in Psychology and a double minor in Criminal Justice Criminology and Africana Studies. My original plan was to go to law school and become a corporate lawyer (gotta make money) and advocate for marginalized groups in the process. I knew that I could do it, but I wouldn't be passionate about it. Just another job. After quitting my graduate program and permanently working from home as a Training Specialist for the Colorado Department of Revenue, I found myself on computers A LOT. I would often manipulate web pages using Dev Tools in order to grab screenshots I needed, and watching the information update live on web pages was satisfying. I never thought I had the type of brain necessary for learning how to code, until I finished my coding bootcamp at the University of Denver in March of 2021.
