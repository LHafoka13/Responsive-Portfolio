# Responsive-Portfolio

This personal portfolio was created to showcase the coding material I'm learning throughout the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Denver. You'll begin at the homepage where you have links to different areas of my webpage. On the Contact page you will also be able to submit an inquiry which will be sent to my email address, and I'll be able to get back to you within 2 business days. 

I did not use any framework for styling. It is also mobile responsive. Enoy!

# Pages 

<h1>Home Page</h1>

The Home page is very simple. It has static links to all the other pages. 

<h1>About Page</h1>

The About page gives my background story on how I got into the field. It also has a button where you can download my resume.

<h1>Portfolio</h1>

The Portfolio page shows 2 homework apps and 2 projects that I've created thus far in the bootcamp. It has links to the repos for each app, and the live links to the app if you want to test it. 

<h1>Social Media</h1>

The Social Media page just has styled icon links to my big three social media pages. 

<h1>Contact</h1>

The Contact page has a form that when submitted successfully, an email will be sent to me with the information. I did use Formspree as the backend processor for this feature.

# Future Additions

The one addition I'd like to add in the future is a box with all the coding languages I've learned with meters about how well I know that language. This would be placed in the About section of the page.
