# Responsive-Portfolio

This personal portfolio was created to showcase the coding material I'm learning throughout the Coding Bootcamp at the University of Denver. You'll begin at the homepage where you have links to different areas of my webpage. On the Contact page you will also be able to submit an inquiry which will be sent to my email address, and I'll be able to get back to you within 2 business days. 

I did not use any framework for styling. Enjoy!
